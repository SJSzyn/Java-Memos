# Loops

## While loop

- The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`

## For Loop

- When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop:
	- **Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
	- **Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.
	- **Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
